[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/simon-xia/kotop)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/simon-xia/kotop)

Get a glimpse of Kafka topic and consumer status

![](./demo.gif)


## Main Features

- Partition leader distribution
- Topic size, leader, replicas, isr
- Speed of consumer and topic size increment
- sort by each field

## Installation

	go get -u github.com/simon-xia/kotop


## Usage

    kotop -broker "192.168.0.1:9092,192.168.0.2:9092,192.168.0.3:9092" -zk "192.168.0.1:2181,192.168.0.2:2181/kafka_root_dir" -topic mytopic -group my_consumer_group


 Or you can use config file


    simonxia:~$cat kotop.conf
    {
            "brokers":"192.168.0.1:9092,192.168.0.2:9092,192.168.0.3:9092",
            "zkhosts":"192.168.0.1:2181,192.168.0.2:2181/kafka_root_dir"
    }

  then

    kotop -f kotop.conf -topic mytopic -group my_consumer_group


## Maybe helpful in the following scenarios

- Check whether the topic data is skewed
- Check whether the distribution of partition leaders is uniform across the brokers
- Check comsumer speed and size increment speed of each partition
- Check high watermark lag and offset lag of each partition
